Issue Summary:
Duration: January 25, 2024, 3:00 PM - 6:30 PM (EST)
Impact: During the outage window, users reported an inability to view images across our platform, resulting in a 50% decrease in engagement on image-heavy pages.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the image caching layer led to cache eviction issues, causing images to become inaccessible.
Timeline:

3:00 PM: Issue detected when users began reporting missing images on various pages.
3:15 PM: Automated monitoring alerts indicated a spike in failed image requests.
3:30 PM: Initial investigation focused on network connectivity and image storage systems.
4:00 PM: Assumption made that network congestion might be causing intermittent connectivity issues.
4:30 PM: Network team confirmed no issues with connectivity after thorough analysis.
5:00 PM: Escalation to senior engineers as root cause remained unidentified.
5:30 PM: Deep dive into caching mechanisms revealed misconfiguration in image caching layer.
6:00 PM: Restoration efforts initiated by reconfiguring the image caching layer.
6:30 PM: Images fully restored after cache eviction issues were resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: Misconfiguration in the image caching layer led to cache eviction issues, causing images to be prematurely removed from the cache.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the image caching layer to ensure proper cache eviction policies and optimizing cache size to accommodate peak traffic loads.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement stricter configuration management for caching layers with automated validation checks.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to provide real-time alerts on cache eviction rates and image retrieval failures.
Conduct regular audits of caching configurations to identify and address potential misconfigurations proactively.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Review and update cache eviction policies to prevent premature removal of images from the cache.
Implement automated tests to validate caching configurations before deployment to production.
Enhance documentation and training for engineers to ensure a thorough understanding of caching mechanisms and best practices.
Conclusion:
The Mysterious Case of the Disappearing Images highlighted the critical role of proper configuration management and monitoring in maintaining service reliability. By implementing the corrective measures outlined above, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and uphold our commitment to delivering a seamless user experience. Remember, when it comes to caching, always ensure you cache with care! üñºÔ∏èüîç
