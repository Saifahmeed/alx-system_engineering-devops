# Issue Summary:
# Duration: January 25, 2024, 3:00 PM - 6:30 PM (EST)
# Impact: During this period, users experienced difficulties viewing images on the platform, leading to a 50% drop in engagement on image-centric pages.
# Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the image caching system led to cache eviction issues, making images unavailable.

# Timeline:
# 3:00 PM: Users began reporting missing images on various pages.
# 3:15 PM: Automated monitoring triggered alerts due to an increase in failed image requests.
# 3:30 PM: Initial investigations centered on network connectivity and image storage systems.
# 4:00 PM: Network congestion was initially suspected as a possible cause.
# 4:30 PM: The network team confirmed no connectivity issues after a thorough examination.
# 5:00 PM: Senior engineers were involved as the root cause remained undetermined.
# 5:30 PM: A detailed analysis of caching mechanisms identified a misconfiguration in the image caching layer.
# 6:00 PM: Efforts to restore service began by reconfiguring the image caching layer.
# 6:30 PM: The issue was fully resolved after fixing the cache eviction problems.

# Root Cause and Resolution:
# Root Cause: Misconfiguration in the image caching layer led to premature cache evictions, causing images to be removed too soon.
# Resolution: The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the image caching layer, adjusting eviction policies, and optimizing cache size to handle peak traffic.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

# Improvements/Fixes:
# - Implement stricter configuration management for caching layers with automated validation checks.
# - Enhance monitoring to provide real-time alerts on cache eviction rates and image retrieval failures.
# - Conduct regular audits of caching configurations to proactively address potential misconfigurations.

# Tasks to Address the Issue:
# - Review and update cache eviction policies to prevent premature image removal.
# - Implement automated tests to validate caching configurations before deployment.
# - Improve documentation and training for engineers to ensure a solid understanding of caching mechanisms and best practices.

# Conclusion:
# The incident underscored the importance of effective configuration management and monitoring in maintaining service reliability. By implementing the corrective measures outlined, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and continue to deliver a seamless user experience.
